# PCIeDMA Circuit Board – Open Source Announcement

We are excited to release our **PCIeDMA Circuit Board** as open-source hardware. This board is designed to provide efficient DMA capabilities, and we are committed to making this technology available to everyone.

Unfortunately, we have noticed that some individuals are stealing our open-source firmware and hardware, pretending to be us, and misusing our technology. These actions have included selling our work at inflated prices and modifying our open-source programs to claim that our technology is faulty. This behavior is baffling.

Despite these attacks, we will continue to openly share this technology because we believe in the power of open-source innovation. To those attempting to undermine us: **you don’t stand a chance!**

We invite everyone to explore, use, and contribute to this project. Let’s build great things together!
